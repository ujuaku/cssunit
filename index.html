    <h1>Stephanie's unit project</h1>
    <p>This is to make you to understand some of the basic units in CSS which
       are our pixel(px), percent(%), ephemeral(em), root ephemeral(rem), and 
       viewport(vh & vw). We are also going to be applying some functions and 
       properties to help us to illustrate how our units work.

    <!-- pixel unit -->
    <h1>Usage of pixel unit</h1>
    <p>A pixel is the smallest dot on your screen. For example below we have square box
       with height and width of 200px, which means there are 200 pixels on a smaller
       screen and 200px on a larger screen, it cannot be changed because pixel is an
       absolute value.
    </p>

    <!-- percent unit -->
    <h1>Usage of percent unit</h1>
    <p>A percent unit is a relative unit, you might be wondering relative to what exactly.
       If you look at the square box below you will observe that it has a smaller square
       with a different color, the smaller square has a height and width of 50%, while the 
       bigger box has a width and height of 200px. Now that 50% is a relative to the 200px,
       the 200px is the parent while the 50% is the child. The 50% smaller square depends on 
       the 200px bigger square. That is why we call the percentage unit a relative unit
       because it can't work without depending on a parent/relative.

    <!-- EM and REM -->
    <h1>Usage of ephemeral( <i>em</i>) unit</h1>
    <h4>This particular text is 2em (meaning 2 * your base value) my base value here is 16</h4>
    <em>Note em is relative to immediate parent value</em>
    <br>
    <hr>

    <h1>Usage of ROOT ephemeral(<i>rem</i>) unit </h1>
    <h4>This particular text is 2rem (meaning 2 * base value) my base value here is 16 </h4>
    <em>Note REM is relative to document root  value</em>
    <br>
    <hr>

    <!-- VH & VW -->
    <h1>Usage of viewport (vh&vw) units </h1>
    <p>A viewport unit takes the percentage of the screen, which means it is an absolute value,
         it does not change no matter what happens it always uses the percent of the screen given.
         The lightblue square box height is 100vh and the weight is 50vw, while the brown box height is 
         100vh and the weight is 50vw.
